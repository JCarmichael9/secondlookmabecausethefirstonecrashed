          <h4 class="card-text " id="infotxt">Henry Ford was one of eight children of William and Mary Ford. He was born on the family farm near Dearborn, Michigan, then a town eight miles west of Detroit. Abraham Lincoln was president of the 24 states of the Union, and Jefferson Davis was president of the 11 states of the Confederacy. Ford attended a one-room school for eight years when he was not helping his father with the harvest. At age 16 he walked to Detroit to find work in its machine shops. After three years, during which he came in contact with the internal-combustion engine for the first time, he returned to the farm, where he worked part-time for the Westinghouse Engine Company and in spare moments tinkered in a little machine shop he set up. </h4>

          <h4 class="card-text" id="infotxt">Henry Ford was an American inventor and business magnate and the founder of Ford Motor Co. He invented several vehicles, most famously the Model T automobile, and changed the auto industry forever by introducing the moving assembly line to car production.
            His industrial innovations were so economically impactful that the term “Fordism” came to refer to the mass production and consumption that they enabled, which then more broadly characterized the pace and nature of the postwar era’s capitalist economy.</h4>

          <h3 class="card-title">Contributions to Society</h3>
          <h4 class="card-text" id="infotxt">While Henry Ford was not the first to attempt the production of low-cost, reliable automobiles, he was the first to make cars affordable to average Americans. Born into a family of Michigan farmers in 1863, Ford quickly developed a dislike for farm labor. As a mechanically-inclined young man, he built and drove racing cars. It was not until he was forty years of age that he incorporated the Ford Motor Company in Detroit.
            In 1908, the Ford Company unveiled the Model T, a four-cylinder, 20-horsepower car that cost between $825 and $850. </h4>
